React- Native Assessment

Product:
The Giphy store displays the trending GIFs and has the capability to display GIFs based on the input keywords.

APIs:
giphy has extensive documentation and you can get all the required APIs from there. Create a free beta API key for your project and you should be good to go!

Here are the features of this product:
Trending GIFs
Display trending GIFs. The home page should be loaded instantly. The
GIFs are of different sizes but they should be rendered in a space-optimized grid.

Filtered GIFs
The store should have a search bar where the users will enter a keyword and the relevant GIFs should be displayed onto the screen. The requests to giphy should be managed efficiently. You should not fire multiple requests on any input change.
You might have guessed it - you can use Debouncing & Throttling for this! :)

Infinite Scroll
The store should have an infinite scroll, where the GIFs will keep loading as and when the user Scrolls.

Theme Toggler
The store should have a theme toggler to switch between light and dark themes.

Play/Pause GIFs
The user should be able to play/pause GIFs.

Download or Share
The user should be able to download GIFs or share directly on whatsapp.
The assignment would be evaluated based on these points:

- Completion of the features
- Proper folder structure (segregation of data & the app layers)
- Code quality & consistency across the entire project
- Reusability
